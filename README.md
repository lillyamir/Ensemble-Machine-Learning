# Ensemble Machine Learning Project Outline
 An implementation of ensemble machine learning techinques using the UCI heart disease dataset

## 1. Project Overview:
- Objective: Develop a model to predict the likelihood of a patient having cardiovascular disease based on clinical features.
- Dataset: Use a publicly available dataset such as the UCI Heart Disease dataset.
- Methods: Utilize ensemble learning techniques like Random Forests, Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM), and a Voting Classifier to improve prediction accuracy.

## 2. Data Acquisition:
- DOI: 10.24432/C52P4X 
- Source: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/45/heart+disease

## 3. Data Preprocessing:
- Data Cleaning: Handle missing values, remove duplicates, and address any incorrect data.
- Feature Engineering: Extract or create new features that may be relevant for predicting cardiovascular disease.
- Data Transformation: Normalize or standardize data if necessary.

## 4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
- Visualization: Use Matplotlib and Seaborn to create plots that show distributions, correlations, and other relevant insights about the data.
- Statistical Analysis: Provide statistical descriptions of the features, focusing on those that are most indicative of cardiovascular disease.

## 5. Model Building:
- Splitting Data: Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
- Base Models: Develop base models using:
  
     a. Random Forest Classifier
  
     b. Gradient Boosting Classifier
  
- Hyperparameter Tuning: Use grid search or random search to find optimal parameters for each model.

## 6. Ensemble Technique:
- Voting Classifier: Implement a Voting Classifier that integrates outputs from the Random Forest and GBM models.
- Stacking: Explore stacking models to see if performance can be further improved by combining model predictions at another level.

## 7. Model Evaluation:
- Cross-Validation: Use cross-validation techniques to evaluate model performance.
- Performance Metrics: Analyze models based on accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC curve.

## 8. Results and Discussion:
- Model Comparison: Compare the performance of individual models and the ensemble model.
- Feature Importance: Analyze and visualize the feature importances derived from the models.

## 9. Conclusion:
- Summary of Findings: Summarize the performance and findings of the project.
- Implications: Discuss the potential real-world applications of the models.
